# foodmarklet

This is a bookmarklet-only version of the awesome [plainoldrecipe](https://github.com/poundifdef/plainoldrecipe). This should be compatible with more websites, because the server version needs a whitelist of domains for security reasons, while this bookmarklet doesn't.

## Usage

1. Drag this bookmark to your bookmarks bar: [Foodmarklet](javascript:void(alert('hi')))
2. Navigate to a recipe. [Example](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a28626172/how-to-cook-boneless-chicken-thigh-oven-recipe/)
3. Click the `Foodmarklet` bookmark

## Standalone

The normal bookmarklet loads js from a CDN so you automatically get updates. If you'd like to run it completely locally instead, create a bookmarklet with the contents of [standalone](https://github.com/kevlened/foodmarklet/blob/master/standalone).
